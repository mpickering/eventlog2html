Name:                eventlog2html
Version:             0.9
Synopsis:            Visualise an eventlog
Description:         eventlog2html is a library for visualising eventlogs.
                     At the moment, the intended use is to visualise eventlogs
                     which have heap profiling events, as a replacement to hp2ps
                     and hp2pretty.

                     eventlog2html creates a static webpage which contains
                     a collection of different interactive charts for analysing
                     heap usage. Trace events are displayed on the chart and
                     the charts can be zoomed, scrolled and filtered to give
                     a more exploratory feel to heap profile analysis.
