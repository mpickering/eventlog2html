Name:                hp2pretty
Version:             0.9
Synopsis:            generate pretty graphs from heap profiles
Description:         hp2pretty is a rewrite of hp2ps, implemented in Haskell, with
                     the aims of being maintainable, with more flexible output, and
                     more beautiful output.  Currently hp2pretty outputs Scalable
                     Vector Graphics (SVG) only, though PostScript (PS) is planned.
                     Not all of hp2ps' options are implemented yet in hp2pretty.
                     .
                     In hp2pretty-0.9 a mode for detached key is added:
                     .
                     > hp2pretty --key=inline *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --key=key.txt *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --key=- *.hp
                     .
                     The output file is an simple text file, that mentions additional
                     SVG files for the legend - how you format it is up to you.
                     .
                     A mode for detached titles is also added:
                     .
                     > hp2pretty --title=inline *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --title=title.txt *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --title=- *.hp
                     .
                     The output file is an simple text file, that mentions the image
                     SVG files.  You could use this for figure captions, etc.
                     .
                     See the examples/ directory in the source distribution for hints.
                     .
                     In hp2pretty-0.8 output filtering and sorting flags are added,
                     as well as low-ink pattern fills for printing:
                     .
                     > hp2pretty --trace=1     *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --bands=15    *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --sort=size   *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --sort=stddev *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --sort=name   *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --reverse     *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --pattern     *.hp
                     .
                     In hp2pretty-0.7 a parsing bug is fixed.
                     .
                     In hp2pretty-0.6 ByteString is replaced by Text, fixing bugs
                     with Unicode.
                     .
                     In hp2pretty-0.5 using attoparsec and floatshow internally
                     should give a healthy speedup.
                     .
                     In hp2pretty-0.4 usage changed since the previous release:
                     .
                     > hp2pretty *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --uniform-scale=time   *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --uniform-scale=memory *.hp
                     > hp2pretty --uniform-scale=both   *.hp
                     .
                     Colours also changed: now they are based on a hash of the
                     cost label, which should make colours have stable semantics
                     across program runs.
