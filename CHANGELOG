0.4, released 2019-09-18

*  BREAKING CHANGE: eventlog2html no longer includes traces which have been generated by "traceEvent" or "traceEventIO" from "Debug.Trace" by default.
  "traceEvent" and "traceEventIO" are supposed to be used for high-frequency events.
  If you want to trace low-frequency events, especially in order to relate phases of your program to memory usage patterns,  use "traceMarker" and "traceMarkerIO" instead.
  If you want to return to the old behaviour, add the "--include-trace-events" option on the commandline.
* Removed "trace PERCENT" option, which had no effect in the code.
* Added warning about eventlogs with a lot of traces.
* Added option to filter the traces which should be included in the
  generated output.

* Added warnings if eventlog2html is used on eventlogs generated by GHC Version without profiling support.

* Show the time the eventlog was created in the generated HTML output.

0.1, released 2019-06-23

* Initial release, a complete rewrite on hp2pretty. Implemented by
  Matthew Pickering and David Binder.
